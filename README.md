## Description

My project as for aim to learn git 

## Installation

Clone the repository in the folder of your choice

Then let's go to the project folder and run the following command (Project Next YEAHHHHHH)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haltazar/TP2Git.git
cd TP2Git
npm install
npm run dev
```
And if you don't have npm installed, you can install it by running the following command
```bash
npm install -g npm
```
And if you don't have node installed, you can install it by running the following command
```bash
nvm install node
```

But to be fair GLHF, you can also install node and npm by being a grown ass man and installing them from the official websites of node and npm. TY

## Usage

To use the project, you can follow the instructions in the README.md file in the root directory of the project.
